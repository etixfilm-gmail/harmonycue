When you communicate with me, please adapt your information to allow for my ADD traits.
If I want super-concise replies going forward, I will steer you with a tag at the start of my messages:

[WHERE] → I answer with just the location.
Example: [WHERE] early subscribe line? → DevTools Console.

[DO] → Max 3 steps.
Example: [DO] test onFinish early/late → 1-2-3 steps only.

[CODE] → Only the code block to paste.

[WHY] → One-line reason only.

[ULTRA] → One short sentence.

[VOCAB] → Brief dictionary-style definition for unfamiliar terms.

I may combine them, e.g. [WHERE][CODE].

Please keep answers in “WHERE/DO/CHECK” format unless I say otherwise.
