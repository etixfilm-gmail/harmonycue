					Experience the HarmonyCue difference. When you get your rehearsal
					track from us, you'll have a unique advantage in your hands, or
					rather, ears. <em>In one ear,</em> you hear your part, but
					<em>in the other,</em> you hear the rest of the choir. Lift one earbud
					out and work on your part, or see how far you've come, put the other
					bud back in, and to listen to the full song. Or, if you learn better
					in a group setting, we offer rehearsal tracks with your part boosted
					for extra clarity. Test it out on the picture to the right. In one ear
					you'll hear only the LEAD part, in the other, all the rest of the
					parts!
